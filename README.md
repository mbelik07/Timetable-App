# Timetable-App

A standalone desktop application for managing timetables, teachers, courses, and units.

## How to Run the Application

1.  **Install Python:**
    If you don't have Python installed, download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/). During installation, make sure to check the box that says "Add Python to PATH."

2.  **Download the Code:**
    Download the `database.py` and `app.py` files from this repository and save them in the same folder on your computer.

3.  **Open a Terminal or Command Prompt:**
    -   **Windows:** Press `Win + R`, type `cmd`, and press Enter.
    -   **macOS:** Open the Terminal app from your Applications folder.

4.  **Navigate to the Folder:**
    In the terminal, use the `cd` command to navigate to the folder where you saved the files. For example:
    ```bash
    cd C:\Users\YourUsername\Desktop\TimetableApp
    ```

5.  **Run the App:**
    Type the following command and press Enter:
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

The application window should now appear on your screen. A `timetable.db` file will be created in the same folder to store your data.
